build neural architectures for computer vision.

Training from scratch a CNN require training from scratch, which is computationally expensive and requires a large amount of data to achieve high performance. On the other hand, transfer learning is computationally efficient and helps achieve better results using a small data set.

Transfer learning models achieve optimal performance faster than the traditional ML models. It is because the models that leverage knowledge (features, weights, etc.) from previously trained models already understand the features. It makes it faster than training neural networks from scratch.

Instead of training a neural network from scratch, many pre-trained models can serve as the starting point for training. These pre-trained models give a more reliable architecture and save time and resources.
